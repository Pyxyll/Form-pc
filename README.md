## Form PC
Form PC is a website that allows people to create and customise their own lists of ITX PC parts.
It will be used to compare all aspects of all components with one another, and allow them to request a build...

## Spec
The Form PC site is built with Next.JS, and Express. The Bootstrap 4 library is used for styling.

## Scripts
For Dylan:

Note: Eventually we wont need to run these as Docker will do that for us.
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
For a dev build

### `npm run build`
For a build (minifies, generates the .next folder which contains all the rendered content, etc).
Don't need to bother with this very often.

### `npm run start`
Starts Next.JS on a port.
